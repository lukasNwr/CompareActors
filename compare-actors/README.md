# Compare actors

This is supposed to be a very simple app that allows you to compare actors from different movies. It happened to me
multiple times, that I knew, that some actor played in some movie and I was suspecting that he played in others but
I wasn't sure, and to figure that out, I always had to go to some movie database web and check that manually, which
is a little bit annoying -> therefore this simple app.

> You can compare one or more movies at the same time and it will show all common actors across all movies. It only shows actors that are in all movies!
